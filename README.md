Autonomous Mecanum Robot -PROBLEM STATEMENT BY SRM TEAM ROBOCON [INTERDOMAIN]
üìù Problem Statement
Design and implement a control system for a four-wheeled Mecanum-wheeled robot that can perform an automated inventory scan in a warehouse aisle. The robot must autonomously navigate along a row of shelves, maintaining a consistent, safe distance to allow a camera or scanner to capture data from the products. The system should use proximity sensors to stay parallel to the shelves, handle corners and obstacles, and provide real-time position and distance data for analysis.

üõ†Ô∏è Components Used
ESP32 Development Board (main controller)

4x Mecanum Wheels (omnidirectional movement)

4x DC Motors (wheel actuation)

2x L298N Motor Drivers (motor control)

4x Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) (distance measurement: front, back, left, right)

Power Supply (battery pack)

Chassis (robot frame)

(Optional for future): ESP32-CAM or mobile phone for inventory scanning

üöÄ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a fully autonomous robot capable of:

Navigating warehouse aisles using mecanum wheels for omnidirectional movement

Maintaining a precise, parallel path to shelves using real-time feedback from ultrasonic sensors

Avoiding obstacles and handling corners without human intervention

Providing live sensor data for inventory scanning and analysis

üèóÔ∏è How It Works
Initialization: All pins are set up for motor control and sensor input. PWM channels are configured for smooth speed control.

Sensing: Four ultrasonic sensors continuously measure distances to obstacles and shelves.

Decision Making: The ESP32 processes sensor data and decides movement (forward, strafe, or turn) to maintain a safe, parallel path.

Actuation: Motor drivers receive PWM and direction signals to move the robot as decided by the control logic.

Data Output: Sensor readings are sent to the serial monitor (and can be sent to a mobile device or cloud for further analysis).

üß© Future Improvements
Integrate camera (ESP32-CAM or mobile) for automated inventory scanning

Implement PID control for even more precise distance and angle maintenance

Add feedback from wheel encoders for speed calibration

Develop a mobile/web dashboard for live monitoring and control
